    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd toy-problems
    ```

### Challenge 1: `challenge1.py`

**Description:**
The Python script `challenge1.py` provides a function to convert a given time to the 24-hour format.

**How to Use:**
1. Open the file `challenge1.py`.
2. Locate the `convert_to_24_hour` function.
3. Call the function with the desired hour, minute, and period (AM or PM).
4. The function returns the time in the 24-hour format as a formatted string.
5. **Testing:**
    ```bash
    python challenge1.py
    ```

### Challenge 2: `challenge2.py`

**Description:**
The Python script `challenge2.py` contains a function, `exactly_two_positive`, that checks if exactly two out of three given numbers are positive.

**How to Use:**
1. Open the file `challenge2.py`.
2. Find the `exactly_two_positive` function.
3. Call the function with three numbers as arguments.
4. The function returns `True` if exactly two of the numbers are positive, otherwise `False`.
5. **Testing:**
    ```bash
    python challenge2.py
    ```

### Challenge 3: `challenge3.py`

**Description:**
The Python script `challenge3.py` includes a function, `solve`, which calculates the highest value of consonant substrings in a given lowercase string.

**How to Use:**
1. Open the file `challenge3.py`.
2. Locate the `solve` function.
3. Call the function with the target lowercase string.
4. The function returns the highest value of consonant substrings.
5. **Testing:**
    ```bash
    python challenge3.py
    ```
